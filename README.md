# DEUS Project

A voice-controlled AI desktop companion inspired by *Deus*, the Israeli TV show. Features an animated floating eye overlay and a voice interface that connects to a remote AI agent via WebSocket.

**macOS only** — uses native AppKit/Quartz for the transparent overlay window.

## How It Works

1. An animated eye renders as a transparent always-on-top overlay (602 PNG frames at 30fps)
2. Hold **Right Command** to record audio from your mic
3. Speech is transcribed via Google Gemini STT
4. The transcription is sent to a remote agent (clawdbot) over an SSH-tunneled WebSocket
5. The agent's response is spoken back using Gemini TTS

## Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/buzagloidan/deus_project.git
cd deus_project

# Create venv and install deps
python3 -m venv deus_venv
source deus_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

You also need:
- An SSH key configured for your remote server
- A Google Gemini API key
- The animation frames in `deus_frames_transparent/` (602 PNGs)

## Usage

```bash
# Eye animation only
./run_deus.sh

# Full system (eye + voice)
./run_deus_full.sh
```

**Controls:**
- Hold **Right Command** — record
- Release — send to agent & hear response
- **Escape** — quit

## Project Structure

```
deus_eye.py            # Animated transparent eye overlay (AppKit/Quartz)
deus_voice.py          # Simple text-based agent interface
deus_voice_full.py     # Full voice interface (STT → Agent → TTS)
run_deus.sh            # Launch eye only
run_deus_full.sh       # Launch eye + voice
deus_frames_transparent/  # Animation frames (not included in repo)
```
